This article highly focuses on the importance of research in advanced. It highlights planning ahead and knowing your product thoroughly through identifying the problem at hand, knowing the audience, speaking with sales teams, and sketching. This is true because you can't just begin a project without a plan. The best products come from multiple iterations and prototypes. This allows the designer to see what works and what doesn't and gives opportunity for user testing to improve the product.

               <p class="info hidden">I love using visuals to convey messages and provoke emotion. I do projects ranging from logo design, speculative design, web design, advertising, animation or branding materials, and other things visual.</p>
               <p class="info">I have worked with sound design to create soundscapes, remixes, sound art, foley, and more. To develop these projects I did field recording, sound editing, and multi-track rearrangement.</p>

               <p class="info2">To me film is one of the most influential and compelling mediums. It involves stimulating the visual and auditory senses to show and tell a narrative. I have created, documentaries, short films, advertisements, etc.</p>
               <p class="info2">Many of my projects were made using processing, p5, and other javascript programs. I love  making interactive programs, abstract art pieces through computation, and overall compelling pieces through code.</p>

            <p>For this project, I created a soundscape and narrative solely through audio. I used a combination of human voices, room tone, different animals, waves crashing, rain, an opening umbrella, and more to create a compelling narrative. Just through sound, you are able to follow the journey of this woman as she goes through a rainforest and encounters a variety of obstacles.</p>

            <p>This is a remix of the song Fireflies by Owl City. I used a multi-track version of this song and rearranged a lot of the parts to create a completely different composition. I even added different instruments and took out some of the existing ones and cut out the vocal tracks in some areas.</p>

            <p>For this project, I did some field and studio recording. My goal was to create a narrative through voice and external sounds. I narrated my morning routine and recorded the sounds that I typically hear as I get ready in the morning. This includes my alarm, brushing my teeth, the shower, the train, etc. This composition allows you to follow along on this journey of sounds that I hear on most mornings.</p>

            <p>For this piece, I used a short animated film called "Dead Friends," muted its entire track, and mixed and edited it using different sounds I gathered from freesound.org. For room tone I used the sound of a city as cars drove by. I also used a variety of dog sounds including barks, whimpers, and sniffing and adjusted their pitch and playback rate to sound as if it were the same dog. I then used different music to set the tone to what was currently occurring in the film.</p>

            <p>"The Cure" is a short film about a dystopian society in which citizens are brainwashed through a mandated pill regimen. The pill, known as the 'The Cure', is said to purify humans of their sins and flaws, thus ultimately creating a perfect human. However, it is later discovered that the pill is actually making its consumers unintelligent in order to avoid questioning and the overtaking of the government. The purpose of this assignment was to research a specific genre and follow the standards of that genre. The requirements were to create a 2-3 minute video paying great attention to shot composition, camera angles, camera movement, shot variation, lighting, audio, and editing style of the chosen genre.</p>

            <p>This mockumentary revolves around the murder of a young college student, Ari Peterson. The interviewer questions both the sister and roommate of the victim. The roommate denies that she had anything to do with the murder but all evidence shows otherwise. The requirements for this video was to create a 2-3 minute mockumentary using B-roll footage, establishing shots, cinema verit√©, narration, and lower thirds introducing our subjects, while paying attention to lighting, shot composition, framing, and shot variation.</p>

            <p>This video was shot in the exact sequence as is shown. There was no post - production. All of the cuts came from the actual starting and stopping of the camera recording. This was a continuity exercise for my Still and Moving Images class. It was shot and storyboarded by Gayatri Nanda, Hanna Rinderknecht-Mahaffy, and I.</p>

            <h5>PROGRAMMING</h5>

         <div class="text2">
            <p>For this project, I used the p5.Speech library to create a program that listens to your voice and creates different animations depending on what you say. You can choose a color and a shape from the list of commands and then change that shape's position, size, and speed solely through your voice.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="text">
            <p>For this project, I created a generative landscape which is programmed to autonomously generate a new building on the right edge of the screen. The color and height of the buildings and the color and size of the trees is completely independent and randomized. I also included a noise function on the clouds to make them appear as if they were slightly moving as well as on the sun to make it seem like it it was shining brighter or dimmer at random intervals. The final result makes the car appear as if it was moving towards the right of the screen.</p>

         <div class="audio"><img class="program2" src="visualizingtime.gif"></div>
         <div class="text2">
            <p>For this project, my goal was to create an abstract representation of time. I used Earth as the clock. The tree oscillates every second, a meteor passes every minute, and the moon/ sun lies in the position of the hour as a clock would. The program is also set to turn the background dark, change the sun into a moon, and turn the lights on the building on (white), when it becomes dark outside. This entire program runs on real time.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="text">
            <p>This program began as a self portrait using code, and soon became into a project which varies many aspect of the face randomly every time the mouse is clicked. Every single click will generate an absolutely random combination of feature sizes and colors, guaranteeing a new face every single time.</p>

            <p>Moon Light is an upcoming event planning company. Through a lot of iteration I created this logo for it. I strategically, chose this color palette with this typography because I wanted something that was playful and family-friendly, yet sophisticated. I not only wanted to include a balloon in some form to give off a party vibe, but I also wanted to incorporate a moon in some way. For that, I created a moon and placed it as the reflection in the balloon. I incorporated the word "Light" as the balloon string with a script font and adjusted its stroke weight to match that of the balloon.</p>

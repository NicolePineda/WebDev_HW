    <p>Moon Light is an upcoming event planning company. Through a lot of iteration I created this logo for it. I strategically, chose this color palette with this typography because I wanted something that was playful and family-friendly, yet sophisticated. I not only wanted to include a balloon in some form to give off a party vibe, but I also wanted to incorporate a moon in some way. For that, I created a moon and placed it as the reflection in the balloon. I incorporated the word "Light" as the balloon string with a script font and adjusted its stroke weight to match that of the balloon.</p>
